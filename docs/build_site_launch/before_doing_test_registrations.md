# Before doing test registrations

Why should I verify site editor settings?

Test your site!

Checklist for site setup

And...you're done verifying your site settings!

Now going LIVE

## Why should I verify site editor settings?

It's always best to go back through your site settings once you've completed site building. This helps you ensure everything is correct before going "live". You want to feel confident walking into open registration, and there is nothing worse than feeling unsure as to whether you're actually ready or not. 

Even the simplest of things can get easily overlooked. The purpose of testing, reviewing, and verifying site settings is to minimize the potential for issues and complications when the site opens for registration.

Better to catch any small, or even very critical, mistakes before they turn into real-world problems.

The other issue is, although we provide Site Testing to clients, the responsibility for site success falls on the client's shoulders. TRS can only support so much, and at the end of the day, our goal is to help you familiarize yourself enough to be able to test independently and understand the importance of it as well.

Therefore, we will recommend this over and over and over again to every client - even if they are highly skilled at navigating and utilizing myTRS software.

## Test your site!

A good place to start is within your site editor, to actually review your settings.

Once this has been completed, we HIGHLY recommend conducting test registrations on your site, as a real registrant would. When you do this, you view first-hand what your site editing skills translate to, and how registrants will navigate the settings you've placed.

Creating "test" registrations can help you make adjustments to clean up your site, and catch issues that you may overlook in your site editor. To save time though, starting in your settings is the first step to determining any problems going on that need attention before the site opens. 

Find out how to test your site thoroughly [here](step_9_required_test_launch_site.md).

## Checklist for site setup

### General Settings

Verify each of the following items are correct:

* Event Start Date
* Event End Date
* Registration Closing Date
* Additional check options (right hand side) - Verify all, including specifically:
* Allow schedule changes on close - allows you to make changes on admin side even after closing registration. It's a matter of preference whether or not you use this feature.
* Enable text messaging (SMS). If you've decided to use text messaging and have signed a contract to do so, check to make sure the box is checked to enable you to use text messaging. Text messaging is at an additional cost. Text messaging should also be tested by sending a single text to ensure it is paired with your account before going live.
* Email settings

If changes are made, make sure you update/save your General Settings information before moving on.

### Registrant Types

* Are all registrant types represented on your page?
* Are you using an access code/codes? Verify they are in place accordingly for when access codes are sent out to those individuals to complete registration under access code protected Reg types.
* Additional check options:
* Are all your registrant types check-marked as public? 
* If you are allowing group registration under any registrant types, ensure all settings are accurate, and consult with TRS before going live
* Do you want to require registrants provide addresses, whether they are individuals or group registrants?
* Do you want to remove the option for a group leader to attend the event?

### Activity Groups

* Are all Activity Groups listed?
* If any Activity Groups are required, make sure the check-mark Required option in is place
* Verify all activity groups are appropriately public or hidden.
* Add descriptions to Activity Groups if needed.

### Activities

For each and every activity you have created:

* Verify that all activity names are correct
* Verify all activities are associated to:
* the correct Activity Group and Registrant type(s) - this is critical
* All timeslots, if any, are the correct dates and locations. Have all timeslots been listed?
* Verify any/all pertaining check-mark items:
* Is the activity required for the registrant types associated to it? (Do you want to require all registrants under the pertaining registrant type to have to select this activity? (i.e.) training )
* Is the activity required for any registrant who selects that activity group? (Not required for the registrant type, but if a registrant selects an item that is associated to the same activity group as this one, will they be required to select this activity in addition to any others they select that fall under this same Activity Group?)
* Is the activity check-marked to be hidden? Make sure activities that should be visible, are. 
* Do you want to list the activity as a priority activity that should be filled first and foremost?
* Does the activity need an access code in order for it to become visible to certain individuals?
* Have you created and listed any requirements that registrants must meet to select/partake in the activity? For example, if someone must be able to lift over 50 pounds to do the activity.
* Have you included an activity description or notes that give registrants more information about the activity if it is not easily understood by name alone?

Ensure you save each and every Activity you modify, before moving forward. This step of site testing is one of the most critical, and is where the most error occurs. Take your time during this. 

### Page Settings

* Welcome Page:
* Do your desktop banner and mobile banner meet the requirements and are properly viewable?
* Does your left column content include all welcome page information you want to supply? Double-check for spelling errors, event date errors, etc. Keep it short, simple, and detailed.
* Did you accidently check-mark the Hide "Register Now" button ?- Make sure this unchecked before going live. No one will be able to begin a registration otherwise.
* Reg Type Selector– Supply any instructions necessary for selecting a registrant type.
* Group Registration– Supply custom wording and additional instructions as needed. 
* Activity Selector - verify the following:
* Instructions - Did you provide any important instructions? Do they make sense?
* Check Conflicts – registrants will receive an error message if they select overlapping time slots. This is a very helpful tool to ward off overlaps. Make sure this is check-marked if you want to utilize this feature.
* Hide Full Time Slots – only time slots with available positions are shown to registrants. Did you check the box?
* Activity Searches – for cases when there are many time slots with a variety of roles, a search feature helps to narrow the list down. This is not usually necessary.
* Hide Expired Time Slots – only future time slots are shown to registrants; those in the past or ongoing will disappear.
* Show Capacities – shows registrants the # of positions remaining in a time slot and activity.
* Collapse Activity Groups & Activities by default: These will condense the timeslots/activities, and or activity groups registrants see. When they click on each activity group, or activity, all associating items will drop-down. This is a simple way to clean-up the activity selector page if there is a long list of activity groups/activities/time slots.
* Sign-up and Sign-in– additional instructions to create a user account in order to proceed with registration. 
* Terms– List terms & conditions. Initial on terms requires registrants type their initials as signage.
* Confirmation & Review
* Verify the thank you message that will be displayed on the site to confirm registration completion.
* Emails– The customized welcome and confirmation emails will be automatically sent to registrants; the confirmation will include their shift details. Did you provide contact information in case anyone has trouble? Are you utilizing the shift cancellation notification feature with your email provided so that if someone cancels, you get an email response?

### Custom Fields

* Welcome Page:
* Do your desktop banner and mobile banner meet the requirements and are properly viewable?
* Does your left column content include all welcome page information you want to supply? Double-check for spelling errors, event date errors, etc. Keep it short, simple, and detailed.

### Rules

Are there rules specific across your site, registrant types, or activity groups?

* Site level rules apply to all registrants on the site.
* Example: Registrants that select Your Site Name Here must select a minimum of 1 and maximum of 2 timeslots (All registrants site-wide must select 1-2 timeslots. The registrant's selection is not limited to a specific activity group or activity, and they can select their 1-2 timeslots as desired as long as the timeslots are visible to them)
* Registrant type level rules apply to a specific registrant type only.
* Example: Registrants who select Volunteer Registration must select a minimum of 1 and maximum of 2 timeslots (Only registrants within this Reg type will have this limit. The limit is for any timeslot associated to an activity/activity group visible to this Registrant type)
* Activity Group level rules apply to any registrant who selects the specified Activity Group for which the rule applies.
* Remember, not every activity group may be visible to all Reg types. Verify your rule pertains to the activity group itself (time slots or activities associated to it), and nothing beyond that.
* Example: Registrants who select Activity Group Boat Excursion must select a minimum of 1 timeslot and a maximum of 2 timeslots (Anyone selecting this activity group will be required to fulfill a minimum and maximum of 2 timeslots within Boat Excursions. They must select their 1-2 timeslots within this activity Group from the associating activities.)

### Check in Settings

### Background Check Settings

If you have a background check in place:

* The site reflects your current credentials and the correct package ID(s) associated to the site
* Verify in your Activities tab that ALL activities requiring a background check have the correct background check package paired to them. This does not happen automatically - You are given the opportunity to associate packages as needed, as we understand not every registrant type may need to submit a Background Check. 

## And...you're done verifying your site settings!

Remember, 

1. We recommend completing test registrations as well.

It's as easy as clicking Register Now on your site. 

(Refer to our article covering how to complete site testing to navigate this)

2. Communicate with TRS for additional Site Testing needs and going live.

## Now going LIVE

There is no magic button we press to turn your site on. It is "live" from the moment it was created. It only becomes truly "live" for registration when you share the site's link and invite people to sign-up.

1. Change the site status

Choose the drop down in Page Settings and change your site status to "live." This is ONLY for internal reference. It doesn't actually do anything except to inform your team and TRS that your site is starting to accept registrations.

2. Share the Site by:

* Emailing previous or newly expected registrants
* Posting the link on your website, or creating a tab specific for the registration site for quick access
* Sharing via social media outlets and other communication channels as needed

You are officially "LIVE." Congratulations on building your site, and good luck with your event!
