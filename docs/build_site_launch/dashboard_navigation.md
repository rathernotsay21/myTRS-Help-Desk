## Quick Search

The best way to find a record is through the Quick Search box on the top left side of your screen. This is a global search feature that allows you to search for records across your entire database. 

You can search by first name, last name, company name, registrant ID# and email address. Your search will often show multiple results that match your search.

The results will include:

* ID number
* Email address
* First name/ last name 
* Site
* Registration type (i.e. individual or guest)

Guest means this registrant was registered under a group. Results are also broken down into two categories: 

* Registration records at the top
* Group leader records below in a separate list

Once you find the right record (be sure you know which specific site you want), click "Actions." The "Actions" button will list several shortcuts:

* View - take you directly to the registrant's full record
* Edit - edit the schedule
* View User - user account shortcut
* Edit Profile - edit the profile for this site
