## Login & Register Now Buttons

For new registrants: If your volunteers/registrants are new to myTRS platform, they would click on Register Now to start their registration process. 

For existing registrants: If they have previously signed up for accounts on this or other events that you created on myTRS platform, they will Log in to their user accounts.

Recommendation: Hide the LOGIN button for all registrants and have all of them start with REGISTER NOW. Once they have selected schedules, they will see the option to sign up or log in to their user accounts.

Prevent registrations temporarily: If you you have already shared the link to your site with registrants, but you don't want to accept registrations yet or need to make some changes to the site, check the box to hide the REGISTER NOW button to prevent registrations temporarily. Please note that we encourage our clients to do multiple test registrations before sharing the links to their sites.
