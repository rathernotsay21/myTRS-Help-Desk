# STEP 4: Set up Activities & Schedules

## What would activities/schedules look like to registrants/volunteers?

## What do I need to set up activities/schedules?

On the Activity Selector Page, your volunteers will see the activities and schedules that are available for them to sign up. Before setting up your activities, gather the following components:

* Activities' names
* Activity Descriptions (image & important information about each activity)
* Determine the registrant types that should have access to each activity
* Determine the activity group that each activity belongs to
* Optional: Time slots & location of each time slot
* Optional: Confirmation email notes (important note about each activityâ€”e.g: must show up 15 minutes before shift starts)
* Optional: Custom Field questions for registrants who sign up for specific activities (e.g: drivers volunteers will be asked to provide their driver's license number and insurance company's name)

Once you have these components, follow the instructions below to set up.

## Set up Activities manually
