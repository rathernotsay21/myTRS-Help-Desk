# Step 9 (required): Test & Launch Site

## Why is doing test registrations important?

We strongly advise a thorough review and testing phase prior to public release of the registration link. While adjustments are possible post-registration, altering time slots will present a significant logistical challenge. 

  

You can copy and share the link to other people in your organization to test for you as well. We also suggest sending it to someone who is not very tech savvy to see if they have any trouble registering. This is a sure fire way to get to the bottom of a problem before you go live, as sometimes it can be hard to spot problems or errors from the admin side after just building the site yourself. An outside perspective gives a better idea of what is wrong with your site.

## Where can I find the site's link to test?

Before Testing: Make sure that your Registration End Date is a date in the future so the site is open for registrations.

## What to check during testing process?

Here are some important items that need to be checked along the way.

Page 1: Welcome page

  

Begin the process by visiting your site to sign up as a volunteer. Instantly you should be greeted by your Welcome Page. 

* Check the wording and dates on this page. 

* Is the information clear and correct? Are there any typos? 

  

This is the first thing your registrants/volunteers will see, and you want to make sure that right out the gate, everything is correct and welcoming.

Page 2: Registrant Types 

  

If your site provides multiple reg types, test the system by going through each registrant type. Can registrants/volunteers access the correct registrant types with any access codes set up? We recommend keeping a spreadsheet of the access codes if you have several of them. This makes it easier to send to other admins.

Page 3: Activity Selector

  

Check all activities, capacities, dates/times, and descriptions. 

* Are they easy to follow? 

* Are the activities visible to appropriate volunteers? 

* Can hidden activities be accessed with the correct codes?


* If you've set rules in place, see if you can break the rules to make sure they were set appropriately 

* * Example: if you set a minimum requirement of 2 time slots, but a max of 3, make sure you can't get past this step by only selecting 1 time or choosing too many such as 4).

  

* If group registration was enabled, go through the group registration process at least once to see what your volunteers will encounter and to confirm you do not need to add more instructions. 

Page 4 & 5: Profile Questions & Waiver

  

* Are the custom field questions easy to follow? 

* Are profile questions shown correctly based on registrant types and activities? 

* Are the required questions required*?

* Is the Terms & Conditions title clear? Can you easily follow the instruction to sign the waiver and continue?

Page 5: Payment

  

If you have a paid site, confirm transactions are going through by testing with a test activity set at. DO NOT go live without testing credit card transactions. Do a test transaction using a small amount of money (e.g: $1) to see if your transaction went through.

## What email should I use for test registrations?

If you are testing the first time, use your actual email to sign up for a user account. If you are testing the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. time, there are two options:

OPTION 1: You can sign in to the previous user account you created using the same email address

* *       * ✅ Pros: you don't have to fill in the profile questions again 

* ❌ Cons: you can't test as a different registrant type and you can't see the Terms & Conditions (because you already signed it last time)

OPTION 2: You can sign up as a new user simply by adding +1, +2, +3 before @ in your email (e.g: [jentran+1@my-trs.com](<mailto:jentran+1@my-trs.com>))

* *       * ✅ Pros: you can sign up and test as a new registrant type & see the Terms & Conditions again

* ❌ Cons: you have to fill in the profile questions again.

It is up to you to decide whether to sign in or sign up based on what you want to test each time.

### Removing Test Registrations

There are two ways to remove test registrations:

OPTION 1: Cancel the registrations (but keep user account)

Cancelling registrations will remove all the schedules you signed up on the site. However, your user account will still be in the system which means you can use it to sign in and register again. Watch [this video](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_v3Gb0W4U8>) or follow the steps below to cancel registrations:

1. From your myTRS Admin Dashboard, go to Registrant Reports

2. Click View on Registration Report

3. Select the site

4. Click on the Run button

5. Select the registrations you want to remove

6. Click Cancel All Shifts

OPTION 2: Delete user account (all registration records will also be removed)


1. From your myTRS Admin Dashboard, go to User Accounts

2. In the search bar, type in your last name

3. Click Search

4. Click Delete next to your user account

## Launch Site/Go Live!

There is no magic button we press to launch or make your site live. It is "live" from the moment it was created. As soon as you copy and share your registration link to the public, people can start registering. If your site building has not been completely built and fully tested, do not share the site's URL. 

Internal reference for site status

Choose the drop down in General Settings and change your site status to "live." This is ONLY for internal reference. It doesn't actually do anything except to inform your team and TRS that your site is starting to accept registrations.

Share the Site with your registrants:

* Emailing previous or newly expected registrants

* Posting the link on your website, or creating a tab specific for the registration site for quick access

* Sharing via social media outlets and other communication channels as needed

You are officially "LIVE." Congratulations on building your site, and good luck with your event! 

## Someone registered before you're ready to go live?

Go to Edit on your site > Page Settings tab > Welcome Page tab > Check the box "Hide Register Now Button" > Save the change. When you are ready to go live again, uncheck the box.
