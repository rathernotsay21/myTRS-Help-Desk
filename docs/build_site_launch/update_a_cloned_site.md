# Update a cloned site for a new event

Each year, TRS clients have the option to clone their previous year's site, retaining the activity structure while updating necessary details to fit the new year's event. Cloning a site saves time and effort by preserving the same setup, allowing you to focus only on the relevant updates. This feature ensures continuity and efficiency, enabling a smooth transition to the upcoming event with minimal changes required.

## Before updating the cloned site

Before Updating the Cloned Site:

1. Go to the site from the last event.

2. Navigate to General Settings.

3. Uncheck the Show site on Volunteer Dashboard option.

This ensures that the old site no longer appears on the Volunteer Dashboard before you begin working on updates for the new event.

## What is transferred and what is NOT to a cloned site?

When TRS clones your site for the new year, the following information will be transferred:

Transferred:

* All General Settings

* Registrant Types

* Activity Groups

* Activities and Shifts

* Activities’ Descriptions

* Activities’ Confirmation Email Notes (within an activity, not the confirmation email itself)

* All Page Settings (except for banners)

* Custom Field Questions

* Rules

Not Transferred:

* Site Banners

* Registrant Data from Last Year

## Components to update on the cloned site

To get the cloned site prepared for a new event, you will need to update the following information:

### General Settings

* The site's name: Update the site's name to reflect the new event.

* Event Start and End Dates: Update the start and end dates of the event.

* Registration end date: if this date is in the past, the site is closed.

* Show site on Volunteer Dashboard: Check this box when you’re ready for volunteers to register.

* Disable Welcome email: We recommend checking this box to prevent volunteers from confusing the Welcome Email with the registration confirmation, unless you specify in the Welcome Email content that it's just for account sign-up confirmation.

* Other relevant settings

### Registrant Types & Activity Groups

If there are changes to the registrant types or activity groups, you can add new ones or remove outdated ones here.


### How to update the time slots (for the same activities) quickly

If there aren't any changes to the activities' names, registrant types, and activity groups, the only thing you need to update on the activities are the time slots. Changing the time slots (shifts) manually can be really tedious, but there is a way to make this process faster. Watch [this video](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrr4f19CNI>) to find out how to update the time slots quickly.

### Page Settings

* Banners: Upload new banners for the updated event.

* Left Column Content: Revise the welcome page content as needed.

* Registration Selector Instructions: Update instructions for registration.

* Activity Selector Settings: Review and update activity selection settings.

* Terms & Conditions: Ensure that the Terms & Conditions are up to date.

* Thank-You Message: Update the thank-you message in the Confirmation & Review tab.
