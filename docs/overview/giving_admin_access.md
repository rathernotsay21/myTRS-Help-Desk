# Admin access management

Grant admin access on different levels

Recommendations

## Grant admin access on different levels

## Recommendations

* Only give manager access to admins you will have time to train properly on how to use the system.

* If admins do not receive the invitation email, they can always click on the forget password button when they go to [admin.my-trs.com](<https://admin.my-trs.com/>).

* REMOVE admin access when someone leaves the organization and should no longer have access to the system.
