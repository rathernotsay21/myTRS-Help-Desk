# Mobile-friendly FAQ

How do I turn on the mobile friendly version of my site?

The mobile friendly version of myTRS is live and available to all clients and registrants automatically. You don't need to turn anything on and there is no additional charge.

  

Do I need to make any changes to my site?

No, everything is ready for you. We added an option to upload a different size banner on the mobile version of the system if you think the current default banner is too large. You can upload the banner by going to Page Settings - Welcome Page - and upload the banner under responsive banner. The recommended size for the responsive (mobile friendly) banner is 350 x 150. How can I access my mobile friendly TRS site?
