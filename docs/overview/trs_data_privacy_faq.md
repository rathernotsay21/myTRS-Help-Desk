# TRS Data Privacy FAQ

At TRS we take client data privacy seriously. We do not own the volunteer/registrant data, our clients own their data. TRS does not share or sell volunteer/registrant data.   
  

Our clients are responsible for making key decisions on their data management and access. 

Please review the items below to ensure you understand TRS client responsibilities:   
  

1. Is TRS data shared between clients? 

  
No, TRS user accounts are client based (not system based like some software companies). This means volunteers/registrants who want to register for events with 2 different clients (eg Special Olympics ABC State, Special Olympics XYZ State) have to create 2 accounts in TRS, one for each client. Client level access isolates user's data access to authorized people in the client’s organization.   
  

2\. What happens when an admin is no longer affiliated with my organization or no longer needs access?

  
Clients have full management capability of admin accounts. You decide who can have access to your account and what level of access they have. You also have the option to delete admin accounts any time. We encourage clients to schedule a specific time each year to check their admin list and delete admins who are no longer affiliated with your organization. 

  
3\. What steps are taken to keep passwords safe?

  
TRS admins can’t see passwords in volunteer/registrant accounts. Passwords are encrypted throughout TRS. TRS clients are repeatedly warned that all admins need to go through TRS training and that admins should never share admin account access. 

  
4\. How should TRS clients reduce risk?

  
TRS provides basic default fields for contact information: email, address, phone number but clients are responsible for creating custom fields and collecting additional data. We recommend against collecting sensitive data (eg SSN, Driver's License Number, Birth Date) unless you absolutely need it. 

  
5\. Do other software companies have access to our volunteer/registrant data through TRS?

  
Integration with other systems is strictly determined by you, our client. Integrations are optional. If you select a software integration (eg background check, payment processing, CRM, credentials) you will have a contract with the that particular company. Our API (integration key) is restrictive so software developers can't access our full repository of data - but only data for a single client that has been approved in a scope of work. 

  
6\. Do you register people from Europe?

  
The European Union (EU) data privacy laws will change shortly and become even more restrictive. Data privacy is taken very seriously in the EU. If you have questions about these changes, please contact us.

If you have any questions regarding your data security or would like a refresher training on how to access some of these features, please let us know.
