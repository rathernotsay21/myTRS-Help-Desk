How to use Availability Report

## When do you need to use Availability Report?

The key purposes of the availability report are to...

* Monitor capacity: how many signed up versus maximum capacity; pull full and/or empty time slots.
* Pull list of registrants by activities and time slots.

Run the report in four steps with as much or as little complexity as desired.

## How to use Availability Report

### Step 1: Select your site

In the drop down menu, please select the desired site.

Activity Groups: Select the activity groups you would like to see in your report. If you want to see all your activity groups, you do not need to select them all, select the other filters and click "RUN."

Activities: In the activities drop down, select one or more activities you want to see on the report.

Start Date - End Date: Run a report for a specific date and time. For example, if you want to see all the time slots for Monday from 8 a.m. to noon, enter the earliest date/time and latest date/time of the time slots you want to see.

Options: On most sites, your options are locations. Select the options/locations you would like to see in your report, e.g. booth type, tour name, job name, etc.

Capacity Status: You can narrow down your report by choosing a capacity status:

* All - This is the default setting; it will include all activities: full, empty and available.
* Full - Displays only full activities/time slots.
* Available - Displays only activities/time slots with openings.
* Empty - Pulls only activities/time slots with no registrants.
