## How to cancel registrations

What does the "Cancel Registrations" button do?

The "Cancel registrations" button in [Registration report](<registration_report.md>) will remove all the schedules and activities that your selected registrants signed up for in your selected site. However, it doesn't remove their user accounts from the system. That means your registrants can log back in to their accounts on your registration site and sign up for new activities.   
  

Can I just delete a registrant's user account to remove all of their registrations?

Cancelling a registration by deleting a registrant's user account is NOT recommended. If you delete an user account that belongs to a registrant, it will result in permanent removal of that account in your entire database (including registrations from events in the past). Go to [User Accounts](<user_accounts.md>) for more information.
