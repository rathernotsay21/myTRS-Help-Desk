When should you import registrations?

How to import your registrants using .csv file

Common errors

## When should you import registrations?

While you can register for your volunteers manually and add them to the system on the back-end, you can only do that for a few individuals. Using our imports function is a great way to add registrations to your site in a large number if:

* You already have the data for multiple registrants (shifts, activities, registrant types, etc.)

* A group of registrants have trouble signing up by themselves

* You want to manage multiple registrants' data before adding them to the system

## How to import your registrants using .csv file

## Common errors 

Your imports might fail because of some common errors below:

* The file wasn't saved with the standard CSV file type: Comma delimited (.csv)

* Multiple registrant types were selected for ONE registrant (each registrant should only have ONE registrant type)

* The shifts selected aren't associated with the selected registrant types
