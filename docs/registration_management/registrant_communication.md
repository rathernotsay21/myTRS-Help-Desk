## IMPORTANT: Before communicating

STEP 2: Display recipients on a single page

If you are sending a mass email, whether custom or a resend of the confirmation, ensure that you set the Display option to 5,000, or a number which exceeds the total number of registrants you will communicate with. That way, all registrants you want to communicate with will show up on one single page. (see step-by-step instructions below)

Look for the total number of entries. Change the display to a number bigger than the total entries number. Then click RUN.

NOTE: If your registrant total for communication purposes exceeds 5,000, set the Display to 5,000 and ensure you know where to begin the communication process with any/all proceeding registrants receiving communication from you on the following pages of your report.

TEXT MESSAGES

* Text messages have a 140-character limit.

* Send a "test" text message to yourself, or someone on your team, prior to sending it to your registrants to ensure everything looks correct.
