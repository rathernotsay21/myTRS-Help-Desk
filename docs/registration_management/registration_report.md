ORDER BY

This is formatting option for how your report's data is displayed once you click run. 

Registered At: Sort by the date and time when each registrant has completed registration

Last Name or First Name: Sort your data by your registrants' last or first name 

Group Name: (If using Group Registration) Sort your data by the list of Group Names for your site. 

Group Leader First Name or Group Leader Last Name: (If using Group Registration) Sort your data by group leader first name or last name. 

SORT DIRECTION

This correlates to the Order By option discussed above.

Ascending: First to Last

Descending: Last to First

SEARCH 

Use this filter option to pull a specific registrant record located on the specific site you are running the report for. In the search box, type: 

* First name

* Last name

* Email address 

Then hit RUN.

STATUS 

Registrants have two statuses. You can choose to run your report to include one status, or both statuses. 

Complete: Registrants who have completed and registered for the specific site 

Cancelled: Registrants who completed registration for the specific site but cancelled their registration. 

Any: All registrants who have registered for the specific site, regardless of whether they have active registration or if they have cancelled their registration. 

  
TYPE

This relates to the type of registrant you wish to include in your report. 

Based on your site build, your site may allow for individual and group registration, or one or the other. 

Type options include: 

Individual Registration:

* Registrants who have registered themselves individually

* Registrants who have been individually registered by an admin. 

* Group leaders of a group registration 

* Group members apart of their group leader's registration

Individual with Items: Includes the individuals shown above, with include of their registration details (activity group(s), activity/activities, timeslot(s))

Group Registration: Compiles the group leader and associating group members apart of a group registration, and includes all group registrations which have occurred on the specific site. 

ACTIVITY GROUPS AND ACTIVITIES 

Activity Groups and Activities can be used in combination, or individually.

How you use them to filter a report will alter the data shown when you hit run.

Activity Groups: Identify registrants who have selected a specific activity group or activities groups. 

Activities: Identify registrants who have selected a specific activity or activities. 

Here are your options when determining how to utilize Activity Groups and/or Activities:

ONLY using Activity Groups (no Activities)

* Selecting one Activity Group: Report will only include registrants who have registered for the selected activity group. 

* Selecting multiple Activity Groups: Report will only include registrants who have selected one, or multiple, of the activity groups selected. 

ONLY using Activities (no Activity Groups)

* Selecting one Activity: Report will only include registrants who have registered for the selected activity group. 

* Selecting multiple Activities: Report will only include registrants who have selected one, or multiple, of the activities 

Using BOTH Activity Groups and Activities

TRS Recommendation: Use the Type: Individual with items when utilizing both Activity Group and Activities filters, to view and verify you have filtered your data correctly. 

It is important to remember that using both of these filter options will:

* Identify all registrants associated to the specific activity group or activity groups selected. 

* Identify all registrants associated to the specific activity or activities selected, as well as any other activity groups/activities they have registered for. 

Example: I select Activity Group, Greeters, and the activity, Info Desk, that is associated to Greeters. 

I will see the following registrants, when I hit RUN:

* All individuals who have selected activities under the activity group Greeters. There may be registrants who have selected other activities within this activity group, who have not registered for the Info Desk activity. 

* All individuals who have selected the Info Desk activity, and any other activities they have registered for, regardless of whether those activities are associated to the Greeters activity group.

CHECK-MARK OPTIONS 

Has checked in for at least one shift?

Includes only individuals who have successfully checked in for a minimum of one shift on your site. 

Has broken the rules 

If you have created rules within your site builder, this will identify only individuals who have broken (not followed) the rules. 

Example: All registrants must select minimum of 2 shifts on your site. You want to identify individuals who originally registered for 2 shifts and then cancelled 1 shift because they no longer meet the minimum requirement. 

Already has a Sterling Volunteers package order in place 

Report will only include registrants if a background check package is associated to their registration.

### STEP 3: ADVANCED FILTERS (optional)

Advanced Filters is an optional tool. It is a very powerful that must be used correctly. This option should not be used unless you are filtering your report to identify specific information.

Follow in the order of the steps below:

1. Set up the first criteria for your search by selecting the field you want to search by in the drop down menu, e.g. T-shirt size.

2. Select the condition for that field, e.g. contains, equal, is greater than, etc.

3. Enter the desired answer, e.g. small; this search will give the list of registrants who selected small and x-small as their shirt sizes.

4. AND/OR. If you need additional search criteria, click on AND/OR based on what you need.

* All registrants who selected a small shirt size or extra small and are new volunteers.

* All registrants who selected small or x-small shirt size and are not new volunteers.

* All registrants who are new volunteers and selected any other shirt sizes.

* AND is used if you need to search multiple criteria on each registrant, e.g. T-shirt size contains small and New Volunteer equals Yes. This will give me all the registrants that requested a small or x-small shirt size AND are new volunteers.

* OR will usually give more results, as registrants only have to meet one of the criteria, e.g. T-shirt size contains small or New Volunteer equals Yes. The list will include:

5. Once you have selected AND/OR, click "+Add Rule" to get a new row of criteria.

For even more layers to your search, you can Add a Group. It will allow you to use both AND and OR conditions within the same search.
