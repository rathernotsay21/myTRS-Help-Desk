If you need to remove a shift (but NOT add new shifts) to a volunteer's schedule, please see the instructions in the video below:

## How to add new shifts & re-send confirmation with new schedules

If you need to add new shifts to registrants' schedules, you first need to disable confirmation email in General Settings. This is to prevent the system from automatically re-sending confirmation with new schedules to registrants when new shifts are added. Removing shifts from a registrant's schedule doesn't prompt the system to resend confirmation.

There are two ways to resend confirmation after you make changes to registrants' schedules:

* Resend confirmation individually (confirmation email must be disabled in General Settings the whole time)

* Resend confirmation in bulk to multiple registrants (confirmation email must be enabled again in General Settings)

Watch the video below to learn how to resend confirmation in both ways.
