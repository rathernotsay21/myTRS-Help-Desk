## Your registrant database

The User Account Report gives you the list of all the accounts created across all of your sites.

Search: Search for a specific account with the user's first name, last name, or email address.

Site Selection: Leave the site drop down to All Sites and it will pull records from your entire database, all sites included.

If you want to find a record created on a specific site, select that site in the drop down menu.

* New Account: To create an account from the admin side (if this user doesn’t have an account yet), create a new account by clicking "New Account."

* Register: Use this link to add a registration to a user account. See instruction video below on how to register for a new registrant.

* Delete: To delete an account, click "Delete" link. NOTE: deleting an account is PERMANENT. All registrations associated with that account will also be deleted across all event sites within your site system.

## Run the User Account report for key information on the accounts, including...

* User names and email addresses: Note that a user's email address doubles as their login identification, so two or more users CANNOT share an email address.

* Number of registrations: Indicates the number of sites the user registered with.  NOTE: If the number of registrations is 0 it means that users went on one of your sites and created an account but did not register for anything. It could either be an individual who did not complete the registration or a group leader who signed up a group but did not select “I’m attending”.

* Number of group registrations: Indicates how many group registrations the user has. FYI: If a user has 1 group registration and 0 registration it means the user is a group leader not attending the event.

* Joining Date: Date the user created their account.

## How to register for a registrant

If a volunteer has trouble signing up for an account and activities, you can add them from the back-end by creating an account and selecting activities for them. 

Watch the video below to learn how to add a new volunteer and register for them in the TRS system. If you want to add multiple registrants at the same time, go to [this article](<imports.html>) about importing multiple registrants.

NOTE: If your volunteers already have accounts, you will need to add new activities for them by adding items to current their schedules in the Registration Report. Go [here](<registrant-reports/update-a-registrants-schedules-profile.html>) to see more instructions on updating volunteers' schedules.

After you have created an account for your volunteer, share the username and password that you created with them. The volunteer can then go to your registration site, Log in using the user name and password you created > go to their Dashboard > click on View Schedule to see the activities that you registered for them. They can also go to Edit profile to add details to their profile information and answer the questions (that you created in Custom Fields).

## Communicate with registrants in your database

Watch the video below to learn how to send email in bulk to all registrants OR registrants from certain event sites in your database.

## Reset password

### Option 1: Volunteers reset their own passwords

Volunteers can usually reset their own passwords by clicking on "Forgot password" when they login. An email with instructions to reset password will be sent to them in a few minutes. 

### Option 2: Admin reset password for volunteers

If volunteers don't receive a password reset link, it is likely in their spam folder OR they have used the wrong email address. In case your volunteers never received an email to reset passwords, you can login to their account from the back-end and create a new password for them. Watch the video below for instructions:
