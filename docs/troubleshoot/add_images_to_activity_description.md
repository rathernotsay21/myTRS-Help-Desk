# Add images to activity description

To add images to descriptions in myTRS, you will need to create URL links for the images. Though this isn't the most user friendly way to do it, here are the good reasons why we do this:

* Faster Loading: URLs make pages and files load quicker.
* Original Image Quality: With an image URL, the image is typically displayed as it was originally uploaded without compression.
* Cross-Platform Compatibility: URLs make images show up correctly on all devices.

Follow the instructions below or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xblxYH1t5-4) below to create your image URL:

1. Go to [Imghippo](https://www.imghippo.com/)
2. Click on Start Uploading
3. Select the image (hold down Shift key if you want to select multiple images)
4. Click Upload
5. Click on the image you want to get URL for
6. Copy the Direct Link of that image
7. Click on image icon 
8. Paste the link in the URL field
9. Adjust the Width (keep the lock icon on so the image proportion is intact)
10. Click OK.

If you need to change the image size, simply click on the image and adjust the width again (keep the lock on).
