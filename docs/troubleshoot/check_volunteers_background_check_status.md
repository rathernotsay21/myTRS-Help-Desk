Sterling background checks typically yield several types of results depending on the search conducted. Here’s a list of common background check results and their explanations:

Clear (No Records Found): No criminal records, employment discrepancies, or adverse findings were discovered in the areas searched. This means the individual passed all checks with no concerning results.

Consider (Review Required): There are findings that may not immediately disqualify the individual but require further review. This could be due to minor criminal records, incomplete information, or discrepancies in employment history. The hiring party may need to consider whether these results affect the individual's eligibility.

Pending (In Progress): The background check is still in progress, with results not yet finalized. This can occur when certain searches, such as criminal records or employment verifications, are taking longer to complete.

Adjudicated: Reviewing results to determine if they meet the organization’s criteria or if further action is needed
