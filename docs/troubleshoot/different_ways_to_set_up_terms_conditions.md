# Different ways to set up waivers

There are two ways to set up your Terms & Conditions/waivers: use our Custom Fields or the Terms & Conditions section in Page Settings. 

## Set up ONE waiver in Page Settings

### OPTION 1: Standard Waiver with Date & Time Record of Signature

This option allows you to have a waiver where volunteers acknowledge by entering their names, with TRS recording the date and time of their acknowledgment. It ensures a timestamped record without requiring an actual signed document.

Follow the steps below to set up:

1. Navigate to Page Settings
2. Select the Terms tab.
3. Add your Terms & Conditions content and any necessary instructions.

### OPTION 2: PDF waiver for electronic signatures

If you wish to set up a PDF waiver that allows volunteers to sign electronically, please contact the TRS team for customization. This option involves an additional fee and may take up to 3 hours to complete the setup.

## Set up MORE THAN ONE waivers in Custom Fields

### OPTION 1: Require volunteers to upload signed waivers

This option allows you to create multiple waivers and obtain the volunteers' signed documents. However, volunteers will need to download the waiver, sign it, and re-upload it, which may be challenging for those who are not very tech-savvy.

To set up document upload for waivers:

1. Navigate to Custom Fields
2. Create a new field for Document Upload
3. Follow the steps below for further setup

### OPTION 2: Record volunteers' signatures directly in a custom field

This option is ideal when volunteers only need to acknowledge reading the waivers by typing their full names, without needing to capture the date, time, or their actual signatures.

Pros
* You can include multiple waivers.
* Waivers can be assigned to specific registrant types.
* We can generate a report showing the acknowledgment for the waiver.

Cons
* The date and time of acknowledgment won't be automatically recorded (though you can add a custom field for volunteers to fill in the date and time).
* The report will not include the content of the waiver.
* Admins can modify waiver content even after volunteers sign.
* Volunteers should not be allowed to edit their profile to prevent any changes to their acknowledgment.
