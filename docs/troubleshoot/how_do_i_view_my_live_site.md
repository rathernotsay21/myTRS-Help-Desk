## Is this the site that my registrants will see?

Yes. Every site created for TRS clients is technically already live and it is the site that registrants will see. The only difference is that registrants do not know the link/URL so they won't go in and register until you share the link with them. To let your registrants sign up, simply copy the URL/link and share it with the registrants when you are ready. Need tips on testing and checking your site? See [here](<../build_site_launch/step_9_required_test_launch_site.md>).
