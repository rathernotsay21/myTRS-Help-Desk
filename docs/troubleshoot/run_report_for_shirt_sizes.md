## Report of total number by shirt sizes

If you want to sort the volunteers by shirt sizes and find out the total of people for each size, you can also do that in the Registration Report. 

First, you need to find out the options that you created for the shirt size custom field question. 

1. Go to Edit on your site card 

2. Go to Custom Fields

3. Click the pen icon (edit) on the question about shirt size 

4. Note the options that you created to use in advanced filter

NOTE: It is important that you use the exact wording of options created in that custom field. If your option for small shirt size is S instead of Small, you will use S in the advanced filter in the report. Using Small will not produce any results.

Save the report in the system (see Help Desk article [here](<../registration_management/saved_reports.md>)) so next time you can just run it and view the information you need.
