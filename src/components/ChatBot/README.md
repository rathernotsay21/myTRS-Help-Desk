# myTRS ChatBot Integration Guide

This document explains how to integrate the AI-powered chatbot into various pages of your Docusaurus site.

## Basic Integration

The chatbot has been integrated into your site's default layout, which means it will appear on all pages. This is done by using Docusaurus's theming system to add the ChatBot component to the site layout.

### Files Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── ChatBot/
│       ├── index.js         # Main component
│       ├── service.js       # Service for handling queries
│       └── styles.module.css # Styling
└── theme/
    └── Layout/
        └── index.js         # Custom Layout component that adds ChatBot
```

## Customizing the Chatbot

### Adding More Knowledge

To add more knowledge to the chatbot, you need to update the knowledge base in `service.js`. The knowledge base is a simple JavaScript object that maps topics to their content and keywords.

For example, to add information about a new feature:

```javascript
// Inside service.js
this.knowledgeBase = {
  // Existing entries...
  
  'new-feature': {
    content: 'The new feature allows you to [description of what it does]...',
    keywords: ['new feature', 'latest update', 'new functionality']
  }
};
```

### Customizing the Appearance

You can customize the appearance of the chatbot by editing `styles.module.css`. The CSS uses CSS Modules, so you don't need to worry about class name collisions.

## Connecting to a Real AI Service

In a production environment, you would connect the chatbot to a real AI service instead of using the simple keyword matching logic in `service.js`. Here's how you could do that:

1. Create an API key for an AI service like OpenAI, Azure AI, or a similar service
2. Update the `findAnswer` method in `service.js` to call the external API:

```javascript
async findAnswer(query) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-api-endpoint.com/query', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.answer;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling AI service:', error);
    return this.getDefaultResponse();
  }
}
```

3. Update the `handleSubmit` function in `index.js` to handle asynchronous responses

## Adding Document and Video Understanding

To make the chatbot answer questions based on your documentation and videos:

1. Index your content using a service like Algolia, Elasticsearch, or a vector database
2. Create embeddings of your content (chunks of documentation and video transcripts)
3. When a query comes in, find the most relevant content using vector similarity search
4. Use an LLM to generate coherent answers based on the retrieved content

This approach is called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and is the industry standard for creating AI assistants that can answer questions based on specific knowledge bases.

## Privacy and Data Handling

Remember to add appropriate privacy notices if you're collecting user queries and feedback. Consider:

1. Adding a privacy note in the chatbot introduction
2. Implementing data retention policies
3. Giving users the option to delete their chat history

## Performance Considerations

The chatbot as implemented is relatively lightweight, but when connecting to external AI services, consider:

1. Implementing request throttling
2. Adding error handling for API rate limits
3. Showing appropriate loading states for longer requests
4. Implementing client-side caching for common questions
